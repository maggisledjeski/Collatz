CSC 330 Project 3 Collatz Conjecture

Each language has its own README files on how to compile and run each program.

The goal of this project was to find the 10 highest step counts, determined by the collatz sequence,
of sequence numbers. The range of sequence numbers tested can can either be determined via changing it 
in the code or prompting the user.
We solved this problem using iterative and recursive solutions, the iterative solution is found in
the main language folder and the recursive can be found in a directory called "recursed" under any of the lanugages sepcified.
