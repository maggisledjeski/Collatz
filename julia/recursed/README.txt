CSC 330 Project 3 Collatz Conjecture: julia (recursive version)

To compile and run: julia -L rcollatz.jl

*to compile the iterative version go into the main julia directory and read the README file

The goal of this project was to find the 10 highest step counts, determined by the collatz sequence,
of sequence numbers. We solved this problem using iterative and recursive solutions, the iterative solution is found in
the main language folder and the recursive can be found in a directory called "recursed" under any of the lanugages sepcified.
